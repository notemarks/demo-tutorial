# Adding documents

Documents can be added similarly to notes. Currently adding suppots specifiy remote URL from which the data is fetched (uploading local files is a TODO). The demo paper included in this repo was for instance obtained from [here](https://mast.queensu.ca/~math474/shannon1948.pdf).

Also note that since this note references the link, it appears as a searchable item.
