# Changing some settings

Under the settings symbol in the menu you can find general settings. You could for instance change the editor settings and they should have an immediate effect.

To illustrate the multi repository management you can add another demo repository. In the repository section of the settings click `Add Repository`. Enter the following data:

- User/Organization: `notemarks`
- Repository: `demo-awesome`

Make sure that the repository is enabled, and click `verify`.

If you now reload the entries via the reload button, you should see the data from the other demo repository as well in the search.
