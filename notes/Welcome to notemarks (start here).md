# Welcome to Notemarks

You should now be seeing this note in the entry viewer.

You can press `CTRL + e` to edit the note. Press `CTRL + e` again to switch back from the editor to the entry viewer.

## Example note content

Notes in Notemarks are written in Markdown â€” so far, perhaps other formats like AsciiDoc can be supported in the future. This means that you can use all basic Markdown features, for instance:

- bullet 1
- bullet 2
    - sub item A
    - sub item B
- butten 3

1. ordered item 1
1. ordered item 2
1. ordered item 3

## Example code snippet

Notemarks supports code snippets:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Highlighting should work both in the note viewer and in the editor.

# Next step

It's time to experiment a bit. Go back to search by pressing `CTRL + p` and start typing _create new entry..._ Press `ENTER` to select the note.
